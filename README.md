Project Overview
----------------

This project is a modern web template built using TypeScript and Next.js. It is organized into different pages and components to create a modular and scalable frontend application. The project features common web application components like a dark mode toggle, contact form, product grids, pricing tables, blog, and more.

The styling is done with Tailwind CSS and the animate on scroll (AOS) library is used for scroll animations.

This is designed to be a starting point for an informational site, blog, or online shop. It includes reusable components and context APIs for managing global state like cart items, products, and themes. The project also includes dynamic routing for the blog section, allowing for individual blog posts to be displayed based on the slug.

Future improvments could include:
- Adding sass variables for easier theming
- Integration with payment gateways for e-commerce functionality
- More animations and transitions for a richer user experience
- Additional pages and components for a more comprehensive web application
- Improved accessibility and SEO optimization
- Integration with a headless CMS for content management

Features
--------

-   Modular structure for pages and components.
-   Dark Mode toggle for enhanced user experience.
-   Cart functionality for e-commerce applications.
-   Dynamic routing for the blog section.
